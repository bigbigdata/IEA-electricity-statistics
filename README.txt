The purpose of this project is to efficiently download and analyze the data from International Energy Agency (IEA). The analysis will be part of my research work. Therefore, the analyzed data will be released in my future publication. 

Since the source of data is open to everyone, the downloading of data is open to everyone. The initial download function is written in IEA_download.py. Please feel free to use it and send me any feedback if you have any.
